# Hi there! 👋

I'm Michele 👨‍💻, a web developer and tech enthusiast who is passionate about TypeScript 🚀, JavaScript 🌐, Angular 🅰️, Vue 🖼️, and NextJS 🔄. I am always learning new technologies and exploring the latest web development trends 🤓.

I particularly enjoy developing backend APIs with PHP 🐘, Laravel 🚀, and TypeScript 🚀. But my love for web development doesn't stop there. I have also fallen in love with DevOps 💻, and I am addicted to automated CI/CD 🚀 and GitOps 🐙 using Kubernetes 🚢.

Currently, I work as the Nau.ch Tech Lead 👨‍💼, where I get to work on exciting projects that challenge me to grow and learn 📈.

In my free time, you'll likely find me coding away 💻, tinkering with new technologies 🔬, or learning new programming languages 📚.

If you have any questions or just want to chat about web development, don't hesitate to reach out to me at github@dellaneve.ch 📧. I am always excited to talk with you. Messages can be sent in English or German whatever you prefer.
